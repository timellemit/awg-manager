// Package orchestrator owns the sing-box config.d/ directory: it is the
// single writer for per-domain JSON files, the only place that toggles
// a domain on/off (via rename-marker), and the only place that triggers
// a sing-box reload. Producers (tunnels, awg-outbounds, router,
// device-proxy) call Save/SetEnabled instead of touching files
// directly. This eliminates owner-confusion (one producer overwriting
// another's file) and divergence between Settings.X.Enabled and the
// actual merged config sing-box reads on start.
